## Overview

Scientific knowledge is distributed across tens of millions of papers, preprints, benchmarks, datasets, and errata. Researchers waste hundreds of hours manually comparing inconsistent findings, isolating unstated experimental differences, and investigating research questions that have already been answered.

**PaperTrail** automates this investigative workflow. It is **not** an AI paper summarizer, chatbot, or generic citation graph. Instead, it operates as an autonomous scientific intelligence engine that:

1. **Extracts strictly grounded scientific claims** with exact verbatim citations and experimental context matrices.
2. **Investigates conflicting findings**, isolating whether apparent disagreements stem from differing hardware, quantization bitwidths, thermal throttling, or evaluation metrics.
3. **Discovers candidate research gaps** across limitation frontiers and subjects them to an automated **6-stage counter-evidence falsification audit**.
4. **Synthesizes concrete, resource-evaluated experiment protocols** with testable hypotheses, hardware feasibility scores, and pre-flight checklists.
5. **Continuously monitors research streams**, updating relationship graphs and generating transparent evidence evolution timelines as new publications appear.

## What Sets PaperTrail Apart

| Capability | Generic AI Summarizer / Chatbot | Traditional Citation Graphs | **PaperTrail Research Intelligence** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Epistemic Distinctions** | Confuses hypotheses with facts | Ignores claim validity | **Strictly separates findings, hypotheses, and candidate gaps** |
| **Claim Grounding** | Generates plausible hallucinations | No passage extraction | **Every claim cites exact verbatim supporting passages** |
| **Handling Contradictions** | Either hallucinates agreement or declares binary contradiction | Shows undirected citation links | **Differentiates apparent divergence (context differences) from genuine conflicts** |
| **Research Gap Discovery** | Generates generic, unvalidated ideas | None | **Discovers candidate gaps and runs 6-stage adversarial falsification** |
| **Experiment Planning** | Superficial bullet points | None | **Formal $H_1$ hypotheses, variables, compute budgets & feasibility scores** |
| **Historical Provenance** | Deletes or ignores retractions silently | Shows stale citation counts | **Preserves retraction history with visible provenance warnings** |
| **Portability & Privacy** | Trapped in SaaS silos | Proprietary schemas | **Local SQLite database (`node:sqlite`) + Full ZIP research exports** |

## Core Scientific Capabilities

### 1. Multi-Provider Scholarly Discovery
Coordinates parallel, deduplicated queries across primary scientific repositories:
- **OpenAlex**: Global scholarly graph with open access status, topics, and authorships.
- **arXiv**: Preprints, raw abstracts, and direct arXiv identifier lookups.
- **Semantic Scholar**: Influence metrics, citation counts, and paper embeddings.
- **Crossref**: Publisher-verified metadata, official DOIs, and Crossmark provenance checks.
- **TinyFish Autonomous Discovery**: Web benchmarks, evaluation codebases, and continuous publication tracking.

### 2. Grounded Scientific Claim & Context Extraction
Extracts structured assertions validated against strict Zod schemas:
- **Claim Types**: `FINDING`, `HYPOTHESIS`, `METHODOLOGY`, `LIMITATION`, `BENCHMARK_RESULT`, `THEORETICAL_BOUND`.
- **Experimental Conditions Matrix**: Model architecture, parameter scale, processor (CPU/GPU/NPU/SoC), precision/quantization, batch size, context window length, and benchmark dataset.
- **Verbatim Grounding**: Every claim captures an exact supporting quote from the document text to eliminate model hallucination.

### 3. Context-Aware Disagreement Investigation
When two studies report diverging results, PaperTrail isolates the underlying independent variables before labeling them a contradiction:
- Differentiates **Apparent Contradictions** (e.g. burst throughput vs. sustained thermal throttling on mobile SoCs) from **Genuine Scientific Conflicts**.
- Identifies isolated factors, calculates empirical uncertainty, and formulates testable resolution hypotheses.

### 4. 6-Stage Adversarial Research-Gap Falsification
Newly generated research opportunities are explicitly designated as `CANDIDATE RESEARCH GAP` until audited:
1. **Target Formulation**: Deconstruct candidate gap into core assumptions.
2. **Counter-Evidence Search**: Aggressive retrieval across past literature specifically targeting prior solutions.
3. **Prior Work Assessment**: Classifies whether past papers already resolved the inquiry.
4. **Falsification Verdict**: Assigns verified status (`RETAINED_CANDIDATE`, `NARROWED_CANDIDATE`, `EXISTING_WORK_FOUND`, `INSUFFICIENT_COVERAGE`, or `REQUIRES_HUMAN_REVIEW`).
5. **Scoping Refinement**: Restricts the question boundary to preserve novel empirical territory.
6. **Provenance Logging**: Records audit justification, retrieved papers, and expert recommendations.

### 5. Practical Experiment Protocol & Feasibility Planning
Converts surviving candidate gaps into reproducible laboratory blueprints:
- Formal $H_1$ testable hypothesis.
- Independent, dependent, and controlled variable isolation.
- Hardware specifications, VRAM requirements, estimated compute hours, and financial cost in USD.
- Quantitative feasibility score and step-by-step pre-flight procedures.

### 6. Continuous Tracking & Evidence Evolution Timeline
- Tracks investigations over time as new preprints and journal articles emerge.
- Integrates TinyFish Monitor to track research topics and publication channels.
- Emits structured `EvidenceEvolutionEvent` records logging what changed in the consensus topology.

### 7. Preprint-to-Publication Lineage Mapping
- Matches early arXiv preprints with eventual conference and journal proceedings.
- Isolates methodology refinements, benchmark shifts, and revised author claims without prematurely merging records.

### 8. Retraction & Correction Intelligence
- Never silently deletes historical evidence.
- Retracted papers and dependent claims are prominently highlighted with visible provenance alerts, automatically recalculating downstream confidence metrics.

### 9. Accessible Dataset Discovery
- Links empirical evaluation papers to verified public datasets on Hugging Face, Zenodo, Figshare, and GitHub.
- Verifies licensing terms and hosting availability.

### 10. Cross-Domain Hypothesis Transfer
- Identifies structural analogies and shared physical mechanisms connecting primary research to adjacent disciplines (e.g. mapping thermal throttling in edge SoCs to thermodynamic governors in biology).

PaperTrail features a bespoke editorial design language engineered for scientific rigor, clarity, and deep inquiry:

- **Typography**: 
  - **Instrument Serif**: Editorial headings, article titles, and hypothesis statements.
  - **DM Sans**: Clean interface controls, metadata labels, and body text.
  - **JetBrains Mono**: DOIs, citations, hardware variables, and confidence metrics.
- **Reference Color Palette**:
  - `Warm Ivory Canvas`: `--paper-bg: #F7F6F2`

## Local-First Architecture & Portability

PaperTrail is built with dual-tier storage flexibility:

### 1. Native SQLite Local Store (`node:sqlite`)
- Uses Node.js native `DatabaseSync` (`node:sqlite`) with Write-Ahead Logging (`WAL`) mode.
- Completely local and private stored at `.papertrail-data/papertrail.db`.
- Requires zero external database setup or cloud account to run full investigations.

### 2. Cloud Synchronization (Supabase PostgreSQL)
- Seamless cloud synchronization for collaborative multi-device sessions with resilient in-memory fallback.

### 3. Complete Research Export Engine
Export any investigation in one click into standardized scholarly formats:
- **Full ZIP Research Archive**: Organized, zero-dependency ZIP archive containing:
  ```
  papertrail-research/
  ├── manifest.json
  ├── README.md
  ├── papers/
  ├── claims/
  ├── evidence/
  ├── graph/
  ├── research-gaps/
  ├── experiments/

## Quick Start

### 1. Prerequisites
- **Node.js**: `v18.0.0` or higher (tested on Node v20 and v26)
- **npm** or **pnpm**
- *(Optional)* **Ollama** running locally for private, local LLM claim extraction.

### 2. Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/papertrail.git
cd papertrail

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Configure environment variables
cp .env.example .env
```

### 3. Environment Configuration
Edit `.env` to configure your preferred providers:
```env
# Application
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000

# LLM Provider (Options: 'ollama', 'gemini', 'openai')
LLM_PROVIDER=ollama
OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434
OLLAMA_MODEL=gpt-oss:20b-cloud

# Scholarly Provider Polite Access
OPENALEX_EMAIL=researcher@example.edu
CROSSREF_MAILTO=researcher@example.edu

# Optional Cloud DB & Autonomous Web Scraping
# NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=...
# SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=...
# TINYFISH_API_KEY=...
```

> **Note on LLM Execution**: If no LLM API key or Ollama instance is configured, PaperTrail automatically engages its **deterministic scientific inference engine** to ensure all extraction, contradiction resolution, and gap audits execute reliably with zero crashes.

### 4. Run the Engine
```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev
```
Open **[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)** in your browser.
